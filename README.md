# Iris-Flower-Classification
Here is a comprehensive README.md template for the **Iris Flower Classification** project. This markdown covers project summary, dataset details, requirements, setup, instructions, evaluation, and more.

Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning on petal and sepal measurements.[1][2][5][13]

## Overview

This project demonstrates supervised machine learning using the classic Iris dataset. The goal is to build a model that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.[2][5][13][1]

## Dataset

- **Source:** Available via UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle (“iris.csv”)
- **Features:** Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width (all in centimeters)
- **Labels:** Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica
- **Size:** 150 samples (50 per species)

## Problem Statement

Develop and train a machine learning model to automatically classify iris flowers into their respective species using the provided measurements.[13][1][2][5]

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)[1][2]

## Installation

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Download the Iris dataset (usually named “iris.csv”).**
3. **Run the main Python script:**

```bash
python iris_classification.py
```

4. **Follow prompts to train the model and make predictions.**

## Project Steps

- Load and explore the dataset
- Visualize feature distributions
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Evaluate performance (accuracy, recall, F1-score)
- Predict new samples[2][5][1]

## Evaluation

Models are validated using standard metrics:
- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correctly classified samples
- **Recall, Precision, F1-score:** Evaluated for each class
- **Suggested Final Model:** Random Forest (high recall and precision)[5][1][2]

## Results

| Model           | Recall Train (%) | Recall Test (%) |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Decision Tree   |        95        |        95       |
| Random Forest   |        97        |        98       |
| Naive Bayes     |        94        |        98       |

Model selection is based on evaluation scores.[2]

## Applications

- Botany research
- Horticulture
- Automated plant identification[5][2]
